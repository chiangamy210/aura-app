    "how_aura_works_intro_new": "Aura has a collection of 53 cards, each with a unique message. When you feel lost or uncertain and decide to draw a card, you are doing more than just clicking a button—you are opening a dialogue between yourself and the universe.",
    "how_aura_works_process_intro": "This process is grounded in a few powerful ideas that suggest our consciousness and the world are deeply interconnected:",
    "how_aura_works_synchronicity_title": "Meaningful Coincidence (Synchronicity)",
    "how_aura_works_synchronicity_text": "The renowned psychologist Carl Jung introduced the concept of synchronicity to describe moments of \"meaningful coincidence.\" This is when an event in the outside world powerfully aligns with your inner thoughts or feelings, without a direct cause-and-effect link. Drawing a card isn't just random chance; it's a synchronous event. The question you hold in your heart creates a resonance, drawing forth the exact message that speaks to your situation.",
    "how_aura_works_universal_wisdom_title": "Tapping into Universal Wisdom",
    "how_aura_works_universal_wisdom_text": "Jung also believed that all humans share a collective unconscious—a deep reservoir of universal symbols and archetypes that we all intuitively understand. The images and themes on these cards are drawn from this universal wellspring. They speak a language older than words, which is why a card can sometimes feel so perfectly, surprisingly true. It’s a message from this shared wisdom, translated just for you.",

    "how_aura_works_observer_effect_text": "In quantum mechanics, the very act of observing a particle changes its state. Similarly, by focusing your conscious awareness on a question, you are not a passive bystander. You are actively participating in the moment, influencing the energy around you and calling a specific card into your view.",
    "how_aura_works_entanglement_title": "Entanglement:",
    "how_aura_works_entanglement_text": "This is the theory that two particles can be linked, their fates intertwined no matter the distance between them. This mirrors the spiritual belief in our fundamental oneness. The card you draw is \"entangled\" with your present state, a reflection of your unbreakable connection to the whole.",
    "how_aura_works_conclusion_new": "We believe the card you draw is always the one you need to see. It is a gentle nudge from a universe that is listening—offering you comfort, clarity, and a deeper connection to the wisdom you already hold within.",
